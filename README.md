# p3l1's dotfiles

This is a fork from geerlingguy/dotfiles. I made some additions and changes to fit my needs.

You may also be interested in my adjusted [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/p3l1/mac-dev-playbook), which configures my Mac from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.
